The quills contain backwards-facing barbs and when used as a needle the quill not only penetrates the skin, it will also stay in place.

Despite having teeth, the whale shark does not rely on its teeth to feed. Instead, it is a suction filter feeder – it sucks in a huge volume of water and plankton. The water is strained through spongy tissues supported by cartilaginous rods between the whale shark's gill arches. The plankton, trapped in the gill rakers, is then swallowed. Sometimes larger fishes – such as mackerels, anchovies, and tunas – are sucked in as well. A whale shark can filter 1.5 million liters (400,000 gallons) of water an hour when feeding.","media_link":"","wikipedia_link":"/wiki/Whale_shark"}

{"animal_name":"snakes","source":"https://seaworld.org/animals/facts/reptiles/snakes/","text":"A snake's skull is flexible in that the individual bones are able to move away from each other. Elastic ligaments connect the bones to each other. The joint between the upper and lower jaw enables the snake to open their jaws as widely as possible. The two halves of the lower jaw are also connected by ligaments, which enable the pieces to move independently of one another. Such adaptations are necessary for feeding on prey that is larger than their head.","media_link":"","wikipedia_link":"/wiki/Snake"}
{"animal_name":"snakes","source":"https://seaworld.org/animals/facts/reptiles/snakes/","text":"Snake's teeth are not used to chew their food. The prey, whether killed or still alive, is always swallowed whole. Therefore, the skull must be able to withstand an incredible amount of stress considering snakes are able to take in prey that is 2 to 4 times the width of their head.","media_link":"","wikipedia_link":"/wiki/Snake"}
{"animal_name":"snakes","source":"https://seaworld.org/animals/facts/reptiles/snakes/","text":"Snakes have powerful digestive enzymes that can break down tough materials like feathers, hair, and bone. Some species inject saliva containing venomous enzymes into their prey. The saliva is injected through teeth called fangs. The venom causes tissue damage and begins the digestive process. Sometimes this venom can be quite dangerous in species like cobras, rattlesnakes, kraits, vipers, and sea snakes. There are approximately 300 snake species that are considered extremely dangerous to humans, although toxic elements can be found in the saliva of many species considered nonvenomous.","media_link":"","wikipedia_link":"/wiki/Snake"}
{"animal_name":"snakes","source":"https://seaworld.org/animals/facts/reptiles/snakes/","text":"Another feeding tactic used by snakes is constriction. A constrictor loops its body around prey and exerts pressure on its victim from two or more points as the prey exhales. The constricted animal is prevented from inhaling; death comes from suffocation. Many of the largest snakes, such as the anaconda (Eunectes murinus), are constrictors. Anacondas can reach lengths of more than 7.6 m (25 ft.) and consume birds and small mammals including deer and tropical pigs called peccaries. One large specimen was found to have a 1.8 m (6 ft.) caiman (a type of crocodilian) in its stomach.","media_link":"","wikipedia_link":"/wiki/Snake"}

Their eyesight is basically poor, sensitive only to movement. Snakes usually find prey with their advanced sense of smell. Snakes have a specialized organ called the Jacobson's Organ, which consists of two pits lined with a sensory tissue. When snakes flick their tongue, tiny particles of scent are transported to the pits of Jacobson's Organ, which then tells the snake all about its prey.","media_link":"","wikipedia_link":"/wiki/Snake"}
